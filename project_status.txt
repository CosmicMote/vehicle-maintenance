Vehicle Maintenance
-------------------

additonal validation?
  - no dupe vehicle names
  - mileage constraints
  - required fields

fix todos
  - not strictly necessary
update drawables script to also convert background to transparent
testing
additional maintenance types?
  - maybe more static ones?
  - allow them to be configured dynamically?

put on github
  - learn svn on github

bugs/stuff to change:
-----

*order maintenance items by interval ascending

backdoor for downloading db?

if no mileage had been input for a vehicle, then editing the vehicle showed 0 rather than
no mileage

*notifications:
  maybe show individual notification for each maintenance item soon/past due?
  maybe show icon and status in notification?
  maybe have notification link to maintenance item detail, instead of vehicle list?
  give user more control over notifications?  

  *how about:
    show notification for each individual maintenance item due
    check for notifications every hour, but only show once/day or once/week
